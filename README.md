# atom-rst-preview-docutils package

An atom package which allows to preview restructured text documents with the python docutils library (original implementation of rst).

Requires `language-restructuredtext` (atom package) and docutils (either installed by your package manager or by `pip install docutils`).


Disclaimer: The package is highly based on the [markdown-preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview/) package.
